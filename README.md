 This contains an assortment of tools Ive made and use regularly. 

ModLister is a nifty little program that searches a directory of a bunch of files/directories, and lists them nicely inside a text file for later viewing/comparing/searching/etc. 

ModSearcher is a program that takes in a list of mods (or anything, line by line really), and does a google  search for each one via google chrome. Has some dependencies for the local machine possibly. Will update this with certain answer later.

ModComparator is a shiny new app that takes in 2 mod lists (.txt), and compares them for either matches or differences. Then, outputs to an output text file for easy reading later!
